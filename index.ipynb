    "# Regression Analysis using Linear Algebra and Numpy - Code Along \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we have seen that in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among data entities (variables). Linear regression is a highly important predictive analytical tool that most data scientists use in their routine analyses. Here we shall try to develop a basic intuition for regression from a linear algebra perspective using vectors and matrices operations, quite similar to what we saw in previous lessons and labs. This lesson covers least squares regression with matrix algebra without digging deep into the geometric dimensions. \n",
    "[You are advised to follow this link for a deeper mathematical and geometric understanding of the topic](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf). Here we shall try to keep things in a more data oriented domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the role of linear algebra towards regression modeling\n",
    "* Apply linear algebra to fit a function to data, describing linear mappings between input and output variables\n",
    "* Develop simple linear algebraic models for simple and multivariate regression\n"

    "We know that the purpose of regression process is to fit a mathematical model to a set of observed points, in order to later use that model for predicting new values e.g. predicting sales, based on historical sales figures, predicting house prices based on different features of the house etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a very simple toy example to understand how this works with linear algebra. Say we are collecting data on total number sales per day for some business. Imagine we have got three data points in the format: \n",

    "(day, total number of sales(in hundreds)) \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)\n",
